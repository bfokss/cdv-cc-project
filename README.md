# CDV Cloud Computing project

Before you start working on the project, please create and activate virtual environment based on the `requirements.txt` file. Don't know how to do it? Check out [this tutorial](https://frankcorso.dev/setting-up-python-environment-venv-requirements.html).

Don't commit the created virtual environment directory. If you use the default name for this directory (that is `venv`), `.gitignore` will automatically ignore it. Otherwise, you should add your directory name to `.gitignore`.

If you install/upgrade/downgrade any packages in your virtual environment, please remember to update `requirements.txt` file.
